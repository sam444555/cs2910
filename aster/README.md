# Aster Setup Guide

### Note: This guide was written during the Fall 2026 semester. Some information may be outdated and should be double-checked if any issues are encountered.

## Step 1: VPN Setup
The GlobalProtect VPN is required access the aster cluster remotely. You can find the download located at https://software.pitt.edu.  


In the GlobalProtect, enter `portal-palo.pitt.edu` in the portal address field. 

Use your Pitt credentials when prompted for your username and password.


### Step 2: Connecting to an Aster Server

Establish an SSH connection using your Pitt username and the desired Aster server:

```bash
ssh <Pitt-username>@asterx.cs.pitt.edu
```
where x is an integer in the range 1-20.


Example:
```bash
ssh abc12@aster1.cs.pitt.edu
```

Use your Pitt password to login to the cluster. I initially had issues  with this and had to contact IT.

### Step 3: Dependencies

The Aster cluster runs AlmaLinux 9, which uses `dnf` instead of Ubuntu's `apt-get` package manager.

The following dependencies are required to compile Prime and Spines:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    gcc \
    gcc-c++ \
    make \
    openssl-devel \
    flex \
    bison \
    byacc \
    git \
    groff \
    python3 \
    iproute \
    iputils
```

**Note:** Most dependencies are already installed on the Aster servers. Installing additional packages requires administrator privileges.

### Step 4: Clone the Git repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sam444555/cs2910.git
```
